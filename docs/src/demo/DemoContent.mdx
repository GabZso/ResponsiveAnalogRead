## Simulation

Move the **input slider** up and down to change the input signal and watch how the graph moves. The yellow line represents the raw value e.g. the value that `analogRead()` returns, and the blue line shows the value after it has been processed by `ResponsiveAnalogRead`. Try quick movements, slow movements, stops and starts and see how the blue line reacts.

The **noise slider** controls how noisy the input readings are.

## Configuration

The configuration controls allow you to test out different noise-reducing settings and see how they behave. `ResponsiveAnalogRead` has three noise reduction algorithms.

### smooth

### glide

### settle
